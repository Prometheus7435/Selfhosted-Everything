* Keycloak
** The Start
This is going to be the first container that I'm going to set up. Why? Because it will serve as the SSO for as many of the other services that I can.

** The Goal
I don't want to have logins for each service that I'm gonna run. Having a Single Sign On (SSO) application will make it a lot easier. Plus I'll be able to place some kind of centralized access control list (ACL). For each of the other containers I'll be using my Tailscale network to connect everything. For example, Nextcloud authentication should use the tailscale url for the Keycloak docker container. The hope being that they will talk to each other regardless of where the container, or I'm, located. Everything on my little flat network.

** Where I'm At
I just got it working such that I can access the site through my Tailscale network. The difficult part for this initial push was how to get the container to use the tailscale network.
