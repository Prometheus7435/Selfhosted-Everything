* Selfhosted-Everything
notes and plans on how I will selfhost as much as possible

* Infrastructure
Most of this will live on my main server as part of / VMs. I'll work to make as much of this NixOS based and will use VMs / Podman containers to seperate roles and security. Tailscale will be used a lot for the comms backend.
